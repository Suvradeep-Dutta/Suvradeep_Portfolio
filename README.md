# 🚀 Suvradeep's Developer Portfolio  

Welcome to my portfolio repository!  
This is a curated collection of my **Software Development journey**, showcasing:  

- 🧑‍💻 **DSA in Java** → 300+ problems solved (Leetcode/Neetcode + custom).  
- 🌐 **Full Stack Projects** → Java Spring Boot + React + SQL.  
- 🤖 **GenAI Projects** → OpenAI API, LangChain4j integrations.  
- 🏗️ **System Design** → Scalable architecture notes + mini implementations.  
- 🗄️ **SQL Practice** → Queries, schema design, optimization exercises.  

📌 This repository reflects my **hands-on coding, problem solving, and project building** as I transition into Software Development Engineering roles.
